While enjoying many childhood summers in Hong Kong, Vickie was educated and grew up in the UK.\n              She decided to leave that often-blustery place for a more permanent stay in Hong Kong in 2006, working in Design and Marketing Communications – before setting up Chantown Creative in 2010.",
  "bioTextUnder": "<p>With an appetite for learning and an interest in oh-so-many things, her background ranges from art, illustration and music, to branding, marketing, PR, copywriting and custom publishing. As a result, she has become an expert project manager too. Vickie gets a sense of satisfaction when she helps people flesh out their ideas, find their path or connect the dots.</p>\n<p>She also writes regularly for Hong Kong publications like the <a class=\"underlined\" href=\"http://www.scmp.com/author/vickie-chan\">South China Morning Post</a>.</p>"
