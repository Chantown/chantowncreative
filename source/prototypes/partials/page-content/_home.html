        <h2>Wait. Who?</h2>
        <p class="leader">Before founding Chantown in 2009 and becoming a creative projects consultant under <a class="underlined" href="consult.html">Chantown Creative</a>, Vickie worked in Branding, Design Project Management and Marketing Communications. In 2017, Vickie established <a class="underlined" href="create.html">studio Chanpei</a> as an umbrella for freelance illustration projects and her work as a freelance surface pattern designer.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Vickie grew up and was educated in the UK, spending many summers in Hong Kong visiting family. A few years after completing a degree in Fine Art, Vickie fulfilled a life-long yearning to live in Hong Kong and revel in a wealth of cross-cultural inspiration, which feeds her inquisitive imagination. With English as her mother tongue and a firm grip on Cantonese, Vickie understands both Western and Chinese culture. Her lifetime of traveling back and forth between the UK and Hong Kong has given Vickie a uniquely rounded understanding on the different cultural and social spaces &ndash; and the commercial markets that result.</p>
<p>As a writer and editor, Vickie contributes to publications including the <a class="underlined" href="http://www.scmp.com/author/vickie-chan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South China Morning Post</a>, <a class="underlined" href="http://zolimacitymag.com/author/vickie-chan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zolima Magazine</a>, HKTDC Hong Kong Means Business and occasionally writes themed trend reports for WGSN. She is the editor and designer for <a class="underlined" href="https://www.amazon.com/3Doodler-What-Will-Create-Project/dp/0692466932">What Will You Create</a>&trade; and co-author of <a class="underlined" href="http://www.culturesmartbooks.co.uk/">Culture Smart! Hong Kong</a>.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, Vickie has an appetite for learning and an interest in oh-so-many things. She loves an adventure and hates perfect symmetry. Brainstorming ideas gives her the same sense of endless possibility as sailing on the wide-open sea. She is good at helping people find their path or connect the dots. She also has an unhealthy appetite for Marmite.</p>
