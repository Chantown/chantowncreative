      <h1>Creative Copywriting and Editing</h1>

      <p class="leader">
        Whether you’re creating a website, a white paper, or an advert or product description, you’ll want just the right words. It sounds simple, doesn’t it? You can speak and write, so why not get the job done?
      </p>

      <p>But copywriting is more than just writing down words. Communicating and messaging require care, because the written word can easily be taken the wrong way, or look odd on the page. And, your brand tone of voice needs to speak of being professional,
        fresh, consistent and on-point, intrinsically carrying with it the invaluable notion of quality and your own investment in your words.
      </p>

      <p>Why stare at the doodle you drew as you glazed over, while trying to master that text? A chat with professionals like us can lead to the crafting of a powerful message – the one you were hoping that squiggle would form.</p>

      <p>With a background in Marketing &amp; PR and experience writing across a range of sectors, we write engaging communications that focus on the key points yet maintain the necessary information. Your message can carry a rhythm that imparts information,
        to a tune that’s as corporate or creative as you require.
      </p>

      <p>For those that need to go the distance, we also offer proofing and editing services on items as simple as a press release or as complex as a book.</p>
